    "The best way to measure quality of classification is supervised classification, when there is a \"golden\" dataset of already labeled (classified) documents. Ideally, it should be a balanced dataset where each class has the same amount of documents - this way we can guarantee our approach will have minimal bias toward one or another class.\n",
    "\n",

    "- LLM fine-tuning (GPT, Llama, etc)\n",
    "- k-nearest embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Without training dataset:\n",
    "- LLM prompting (prompt contains text description of all classes)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Important] If you use \"golden\" dataset for training, remember to divide it to two parts: use 80% of your data as training, and 20% as test data. This way you can validate how your approach will work with new data, that is not appeared in training dataset.\n"
